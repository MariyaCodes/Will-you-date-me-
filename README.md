Wanna go on a date with your crush? 💅💘 Link https://mariyacodes.github.io/Will-you-date-me-/
Send them this website and let the chaos unfold 😎
It starts off all cute — soft pink background, big ol’ “Will You Date Me?” energy 💖
But here’s the catch:
They can’t click “No.” Like, literally. It runs faster than your feelings after being left on read 🏃💨
✅ “Yes” brings love, light, and possible relationship status update 💍
❌ “No”? LOL, good luck. That button’s dodging like it owes someone money 😩
Built with HTML/CSS/JS and 100% clingy energy 💻💅
